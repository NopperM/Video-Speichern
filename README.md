# Garmin voice activated clipping
A meme-inspired voice tool that saves NVIDIA GeForce clips when you say "Okay Garmin, Video speichern" — born from that viral car dashcam video!

# Absolute cinema
This project started when:
1. I realized that this had more potential as a tool than a meme
2. I realized that Garmin is a goated name
3. I needed a handsfree method of clipping videos!

# Features
- "Okay Garmin" activation (plus "Okay Garn", "Okay Car" — because voice AIs are quirky)
- Delayed ALT+F10 (so you can hear the little boopty boop after you say "Video speichern")
- Custom sounds (add your own audio if you want!)
- Meme worthy as fuck

# Quick start
pip install pygame SpeechRecognition pyautogui  
python Garmin.py
